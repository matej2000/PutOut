PutOut! is a simple first-person action game. To run the game, download and extract the repository. 
Make sure the game files are in the same directory as the server you're going to be running it on -
the game should be available on http://localhost:{`number of the port of which the host server`} address.
(If you're using VS Code's Live Server or something along those lines you don't have to worry about that, the extension will open up the game automatically in your browser).
